}
\arguments{
\item{.df}{A data.frame or tibble that contains the categorical variables in \code{var}.}

\item{var}{A vector of categorical variables to include in the plot. Can be a named list to automatically rename the variables in the plot.}

\item{colors}{A named vector of colours to assign to each level of the \code{var} variable in format of \verb{description == color code}. The order of the vector will be used in the legend.}

\item{print_data}{A helper option to print some raw data to the consele. Can be helpful when debugging, or adding data to reports.}

\item{rev_fill}{Used to reverse the color of the bars in the plot.}

\item{xaxis_size}{The size of the text on the x-axis.}

\item{yaxis_size}{The size of the text on the y-axis.}

\item{legend_size}{The size of the text on the legend.}

\item{label_width}{The number of characters before words wrap. Used in the y-axis and legend.}

\item{pct_cut}{Categories with a pct > than this value will not print the \% on the plot.}

\item{save}{A logical to determine if the plot should be saved to your working directory "plots/**.png".}

\item{bg}{Background color.}

\item{width}{Width of plot.}

\item{height}{Height of plot.}

\item{units}{Unit of plot size.}

\value{
A ggplot object. This means you should be able to make further adjustments to it if required.
